# Tick Tick Bloom: Harmful Algal Bloom Detection Challenge

Last update 27.12.22

## About project
Our goal in this challenge is to use satellite imagery to detect and classify 
the severity of cyanobacteria blooms in small, inland water bodies. 
This will help water quality managers better allocate resources for in situ 
sampling and make more informed decisions around public health warnings for drinking water and recreation.
